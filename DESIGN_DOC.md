# Main Concept

You are a mantis shrimp that has to beat up numerous other sea creatures to recover your car after it was confiscated for not passing the smog check. You are the bad guy in this game. The final boss will be the president of the country and the penultimate boss will be the EPA chairman.

## Goals

- Get a good grade and credits

You can "parry" an attack by doing a basic attack at the same time the enemy opponent hits you. With a certain item (exact TBD), the opponent will also be stunned. The heavy attac

If you attack just slightly before your opponent, you will miss the attack.
### Map
The whole game will be encompassed in one medium-sized map. There will be many secrets with treasure that the player can collect to encourage exploration.
